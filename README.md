# sqlite3-mosques-system
sqlite3 and tkinter combined for a mosques program

this program is a GUI that takes inputs, save them in a database.
It is a mosques program which can add, delete, update imam_name of mosque, show database records, search for a mosque.
I used 2 files, 1 as a class for the database named Mosque, then imported it on the application file.


Note: this program was an assignment, so one of the buttons(display on map)'s functionality was extra credit which I didn't really have any time for at the time, so it is there as a design since it is a requirement, but the functionality is not.


I would appreciate your feedback.
