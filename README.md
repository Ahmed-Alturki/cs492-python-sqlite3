# Sqlite3 & Tkinter Mosques Management System


## Project Description
This program is a GUI that takes various inputs regarding mosques, and save them in a database.
It can add, delete, update imam_name of mosque, show database records, search for a mosque.
Mosque class is in a seperate file.


Note: this program was an assignment, so one of the buttons(display on map)'s functionality was extra credit which I didn't really have time for at the time, so it is there as a button since it is a requirement, but the functionality is not.
